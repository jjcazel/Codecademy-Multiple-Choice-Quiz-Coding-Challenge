Hi Codecademy Team! ðŸ‘‹

I enjoyed this project. I tried to keep the code as simple and readable as possible. 
- I only used two hooks (useEffect, useState).  
- I kept two components in one file (`Quiz` and `Questions`). 
  - I decided to do it this way to keep it a bit modular although most of the component's logic is contained in the `Quiz` component. 
- I decided to use `localStorage` once to keep the total number of attempts for the user so this would persist after refreshing. 
- There is a landing page (`'/'`) to get to the quiz (`'/quiz'`) page. 
- One challenge I faced was the complex logic in the `handleNext` function depending on whether I was at the end of a quiz or needed to get more questions (at the end of all quizzes).  

This took me about ~6 hours with the delighters. I chose to complete delighter **A** and **B**.

Thanks for the opportunity! I look forward to talking soon!
